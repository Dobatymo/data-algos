## Algorithm
- is a: 'Effective method'
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm
- fully defined procedure

## Iterative method
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_method
- Algorithm which lacks certain things, eg. hyperparameters or termination criterion

## Heuristic
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic
- uses 'educated guesses' or 'profiling'

## Metaheuristic
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaheuristic
- a method to select a heuristic based on data
- also see: 'no free lunch theorem'

## Distance measure
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance
- a description of how to calculate the similarity or distance between two objects (numbers, vectors, strings, images, ...)

## Spigot algorithm
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spigot_algorithm
- http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SpigotAlgorithm.html
- calculate mathematical constants to arbitrary precision with limited intermediate storage

## Anytime algorithm
- also called: 'Interruptible algorithm'
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anytime_algorithm
- iterative algorithm were each steps improves the result. can be stopped anytime to get an approximation.

## Sequential algorithm
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_algorithm
- "executed sequentially – once through, from start to finish, without other processing executing – as opposed to concurrently or in parallel."
- cf: 'Streaming algorithm', 'Online algorithm'
