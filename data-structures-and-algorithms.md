# Data structures

## Array
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure
- implemented in: 'C++ std::vector', 'Python list', 'Python tuple'
- continuous list of elements in memory. fast to iterate, fast to access by index. slow to find by value, slow to insert/delete within the array (as memory always need to be continuous, they need to be reallocated)
- usually fast to append/delete at the end or beginning (if there is free memory and depending on exact implementation)

## Linked list
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list
- single elements in memory which contain a pointer to the next element in the sequence
- double linked list also contain pointers back to the previous element int the sequence (XOR linked list is a clever optimization)
- insert and delete can be constant time if pointers are already found. iteration is slow. access by index is not possible, search by value in linear.
- implemented in: 'C++ std::list'

## Hash table
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table
- used to implement maps: 'Python dict', 'std::unordered_map'
- probably the most important data structure in Python
- has basically perfect complexity for a good hash function. (Minimal) perfect hashing can be used if the keys are known in advance.
- ordering depends on implementation (python 3.7 garuantees preservation of insertion order, whereas C++ as the name says does not define any ordering)
- even though hashing is constant in time, it might still be slow. also the hash consumes space
- hash tables usually have set characteristics (ie. the can test in average constant time if an item is the table or not)

### complexity, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table
Average	Worst case
Space		O(n)	O(n) # often a lot of padding space is needed...
Search		O(1)	O(n)
Insert		O(1)	O(n)
Delete		O(1)	O(n)
