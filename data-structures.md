# Data structures

## Array
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure
- implemented in: 'C++ std::vector', 'Python list, tuple'
- continuous list of elements in memory. fast to iterate, fast to access by index. slow to find by value, slow to insert/delete within the array (as memory always need to be continuous, they need to be reallocated)
- usually fast to append/delete at the end or beginning (if there is free memory and depending on exact implementation)

## Linked list
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list
- single elements in memory which contain a pointer to the next element in the sequence
- double linked list also contain pointers back to the previous element int the sequence (XOR linked list is a clever optimization)
- insert and delete can be constant time if pointers are already found. iteration is slow. access by index is not possible, search by value in linear.
- implemented in: 'C++ std::list, std::forward_list'
- can be: 'Persistent data structure'

- implements: 'Set', 'Multiset', 'Map'
- used to implement: 'Python dict', 'C++ std::unordered_set', 'C++ std::unordered_multiset', 'C++ std::unordered_map'
- probably the most important data structure in Python
- has basically perfect complexity for a good hash function. (Minimal) perfect hashing can be used if the keys are known in advance.
- ordering depends on implementation (python 3.7 garuantees preservation of insertion order, whereas C++ as the name says does not define any ordering)
- even though hashing is constant in time, it might still be slow. also the hash consumes space.
- time complexity (search, insert, delete) (average): O(1)
- time complexity (search, insert, delete) (worst): O(n)
- space complexity (average): O(n)
- space complexity (worst): O(n) # often a lot of padding space is needed...

- if implemented with hashmaps, indexing by key can be done in O(sequence-length) independent of tree size
- not very space efficient. common prefixed only have to be stored once, but pointers to next element of sequence uses more memory than what is saved.
